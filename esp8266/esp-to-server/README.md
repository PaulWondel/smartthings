# Weather Station with ESP8266

## Libraries
Required library from RicArch97: https://github.com/RicArch97/ESP-smart-things.

## Important note
To use the ssid and password you will need to create your own `credentials.h` headerfile using
the `credentials_example.h`. You can simply just copy it.  
To upload the data to your own website edit the information in the `httpclient.h` file.

## Design
The fritzing and electrical schemes still need to be added and will be soon.
